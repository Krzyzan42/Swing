## injection

Maybe it's unnecesary, but if you want to check it out and use it:

injectors need to be set up in every scene, so they can provide easy access to many different things

by injector I mean a monobehaviour with Scene Context and probably different installers

add necessary Installers to Scene Context/Mono Installers

## event channels

decouples modules

to create an instance, right click Assets/Create/Events...

then if using injectors you can assign them or create new installers / extend exisiting ones

## spikes

if you want to change width, change width in Spikes script and click right on component "Generate Spikes"
